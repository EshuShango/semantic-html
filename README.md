## Description

Heriseon Marketing Agency's website is functional,
but some of the html elements were not optimized for Search engine Optimization.
I have refactored some of the html elements to be more semantic and consolidated
CSS code



## Things I learned

- When able combine css selectors that have the same attributes/values between there brackets,
but remember to add a comma to keep them separated.

- Take time to observe the code and one thing at a time

- Things can always be better

## Task 
- refactored HTML to be more semantic
- consolidated CSS
- created a README file

## Roadmap
more can be done visually, and more content to display the culture at Heriseon
