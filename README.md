## Description

Heriseon Marketing Agency's website is functional,
but some of the html elements were not optimized for Search engine Optimization.
I have refactored some of the html elements to be more semantic and combined a
few css selectors to not repeat code



### Things I learned

combine css selectors that have the same attributes/values between there brackets,
but remember to add a comma to keep them separated.

take time to observe the code and one thing at a time

### Challenge Elements

Challenges adhere to a format that's commonly used by software development teams that use **agile project management** to manage their work. Practicing this will prepare you for the workflows you'll experience as a professional full-stack web developer. 

> **Deep Dive**: To learn more about agile, read this [Wikipedia article on agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).



This week is an odd-numbered week, so your Challenge is an on-the-job ticket&mdash;meaning that you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. 

**Refactoring** existing code

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
